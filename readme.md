## Title

**Identifying Ultimate Beneﬁcial Ownership from Complex Corporate Structures using Graph Machine Learning**

## Abstract
This master’s thesis addresses the complex landscape of corporate ownership structures and the identiﬁcation of their Ultimate Beneﬁcial Owners (UBOs). As businesses expand, their ownership structures become more complex, providing opportunities for concealing illegal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. Therefore, regulatory authorities are now prioritizing the analysis of these structures in order to identify individuals with absolute decision-making power and control. Existing algorithmic approaches leverage mathematics to identify UBO s. However, these methods demonstrate poor scalability as ownership structures grow, and the convergence of the algorithms is not guaranteed.

This thesis introduces a novel approach to UBO identiﬁcation, representing ownership structures as graphs and framing the UBO identiﬁcation task as an inductive link prediction problem. Leveraging publicly accessible ownership data, a graph machine learning model is trained and evaluated for its overall
performance and potential to address the existing problems.

The result is a machine learning model that provides reliable predictions and, in some cases, mitigates problems of the traditional algorithmic approach. These results underscore the viability of graph-based machine learning as a valuable method for identifying UBO s within complex ownership structures. A robust machine learning model for UBO identiﬁcation has signiﬁcant applications across various industries and scientiﬁc domains, strengthening transparency, compliance, and risk mitigation, while combating ﬁnancial crime, ensuring ethical practices, and supporting responsible resource management.
